# Derby Kingz ⚾👑  
*A 2D Home Run Derby Game Made with Godot and GDScript*

## 🎮 The Jist

**Derby Kingz** is a retro 2D baseball home run derby styled game where the goal is simple: **smash as many home runs as you can** before the time runs out. This game was inspired solely based off of my love and passion for baseball and my longing love for retro 2D arcade games such as PACMAN and Centipede.

There are ***5**** rounds that last **2 minutes**. Use the space bar to load up your power bar, the higher the power bar is loaded up, the further the ball goes! Release the space bar as you time it up with the pitch, and see if you hit a homerun!

This project was built using the **Godot Engine** and coded entirely in **GDScript**.
